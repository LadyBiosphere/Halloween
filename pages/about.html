						<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
						<p>October 2016: I taught an introductory web design class. In this class, my students learned about HTML5 and CSS3 - the building blocks of current web design and development. Assuming no knowledge, I taught my students the basics and offered opportunities to apply their learning.</p>
						<p>I created many exercises for my students, including this one. This exercise was the final test of learning and it allowed students to see how the building blocks could be arranged to create a final, consumable product - a simple website. Because it was approaching halloween, I settled on a fun (but silly) website design that was inspired by Michael Jackson&rsquo;s &lsquo;<a href="https://youtu.be/4V90AmXnguw" target="_blank" title="This music video will open in YouTube.">Thriller</a>&rsquo;.</p>
						<iframe src='http://gifs.com/embed/thriller-O7JYKN' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='360px' style='-webkit-backface-visibility: hidden;-webkit-transform: scale(1);'' ></iframe>
						<p>For the purposes of this classroom exercise, I obtained a few assets through a simple Google search. In no shape or form do I profit from the photos that I have used here. And with that, I do not claim them as my own. I would like to thank the original owners for their fantastic content and work; my students thoroughly enjoyed working with these as creative assets.</p>
						<p>Happy halloween!</p>
